### Data science cheat sheets
- data_visualization_cheat_sheet(1/2).ipynb - Matplotlib and Seaborn visualization
- pandas_joining_tables.ipynb - merging/joining pandas DataFrames in different ways
- decision_tree_classifier.ipynb - decision tree, classification evaluation metrics, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning
- random_forest.ipynb - random forest
- logistic_regression_and_EDA.ipynb - logistic regression, EDA to find linearly correlated data with a target variable

Note that these are not any kind of serious projects; I just like to implement and experiment with some functionalities that I'm studying, and sometimes I upload them to GitHub.
